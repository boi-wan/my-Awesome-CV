    	\begin{cvitem}
    	My team main focus is on external partner relationship, to whom we provide our platform as a service.
            The working group includes several back-end engineers, a QA, a PO and few front-enders. Main technology keys:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Micro-services architecture (\textit{Terraform} and \textit{Kubernetes})
                \item Scala \textit{2.13} on \textit{JDK 11}, with \textit{Akka} and \textit{Cats}
                \item MySQL 8
                \item CI/CD with \textit{GitLab}
                \item Monitoring powered by \textit{Kibana} and \textit{Graphana}
            \end{itemize}
            Our architecture consists of a hundred services, that communicates both synchronously through API call and events as we are working for migrating it to an event-driven structure (through \textit{Kafka}).
    	My team follows a hybrid \textit{Kanban/Scrum} approach, giving us the flexibility to extreme release (hundred times per         week). Main activities:
    	\begin{itemize}
    	    \item Analysis, design and implementation of new product functionalities;
    	    \item Public APIs, Event and Architecture guilds
                \item Complexity estimation;
                \item REST API/Event develop and extension;
      	    \item Database design and implementation.
    	\end{itemize}
            Given my team focus and the lack of domain segregation in our architecture, the day-by-day work might include several different domains. Depending on the kind of initiative, I might have to extend the user activation flow, or the invoice generation process. We work like cross-domain, and I have to be flexible and know as much as possible of the entire platform.
